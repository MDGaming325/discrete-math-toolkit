# discrete-math-toolkit

Essential tools for students studying discrete mathematics and computer science. Here you'll find repository of files designed to do common operations in these fields.

## ðŸ“š Goals to Pursue

This repository aims to offer solutions for:

- **Basic Operations in Discrete Math:** Fundamental operations used in this field.
  
- **Diophantine Equations:** Tools for solving Diophantine equations with(out) restrictions.

- **Modular Arithmetic:** Functions for performing arithmetic operations in modular arithmetic and the applied use in Criptography like RSA.

- **Combinatory:** Solutions related to combinatorics, permutations, and combinations.

- **Homogeneous and Non-Homogeneous Recursion:** Implementations for solving recursive problems, both homogeneous and non-homogeneous cases.
